            <p>Let’s face it, some web interfaces make you want to punch your screen (we’re looking at you, Hulu). But if you’re the kind of person who’s bursting with ideas on how to make the experience better, UX design might be the side hustle—or even a new career—for you. As a User Experience (UX) designer, you can compile research and determine which visual and text elements help people navigate apps and websites. To better understand what it takes, Sidekick spoke with two UX designers—Cameron Motameni and Tobias Komischke. In case you saw “visual art” and thought it was time to stop reading, rest assured—you don’t need to be Picasso or Michelangelo to pursue UX design. You don’t even need a formal education. You should, however, choose a role within the field of UX you feel most comfortable with, Komischke advised. For instance, information architecture requires the “organization and labeling of the content you have in your system,” whereas interaction design is “how you allow a user to actually accomplish anything on your system.” Neither requires visual design expertise.</p>

            <p>Once you settle on a focus, you can pick up skills such as prototyping and working with design systems like Figma and Balsamiq online, Komischke said. While Motameni told us you can take college courses, or online classes through Udemy or Coursera, he gained his skills from YouTube and his sister’s class notes. Other tips from our experts:</p>

              <h3>Practice as much as possible.</h3>
              <p>Build skills with online courses and exercises, or offer discounted rates on platforms like Fiverr to gain experience. When you can proficiently design pages and systems, you can start to pitch your services to clients at higher rates. “In the beginning, your reputation is a lot more valuable than the money you’re receiving. My strategy was to make my prices really low to gain a small number of customers. [If] they came back for more screens, I would tell them I’m going to lock them in at the initial price [even if I raised my prices] just to keep that customer-client relationship,” Motameni shared.</p>

              <h6>Create mock-ups.</h6>
              <p>“[Produce] portfolio pieces to have something to show, to go after some freelancing jobs,” Komischke said. These can be prototypes for real companies or fake ones, but they should demonstrate designs for various screens and formats.</p>

              <h6>Get familiar with other UX skills.</h6>
              <p>That includes research. “This [is not] a black and white world where a researcher would never do anything like sampling design, or a designer would never talk to a user. It’s actually a blended world,” Komischke said.</p>

           <h3>Focus on problem-solving.</h3>
           <p>Practice soft skills before you get caught in the “design” part of the projects. “Talk to clients and see what their ideas are. You don’t want to be too pigeon-holed on one solution. You want to be able to see [the problem] with an open mind and a new perspective to prioritize what [the client] wants in an app,” Motameni explained.

           <h3>Sell what you’re good at.</h3>
           <p>Visual design may not be your strong suit, but maybe copywriting or interaction design is. “There are so many talented artists out there who can draw or just have an eye for visual design that you see in apps, but that’s definitely not my skill set,” Motameni said. “[But] if you understand how elements can be laid out in an app, then that’s more valuable than your artistic skills.”—SS</p>
